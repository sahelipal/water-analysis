# water-analysis

## What's the problem ?
<hr>
We have created a website using Android Studio, Mysql, Jupyter Notebook.
We have predicted the quality of water using Machine learning algorithm. We have taken a dataset and have formatted the data to fit into the ML model. We have trained the model using the random forest classifier and it has given us a perfect efficiency of 100%.blem ?
There is scarcity of clean water in the whole world. 

## How technology helps ?

We have created a android application using Android Studio, Mysql, Jupyter Notebook.
